# Advanced Multi Search

This project implements a flexible multi-search filter component that allows users to search across multiple fields and data types. It's designed to be a barebones foundation that you can extend to fit your own application needs.

Feel free to use, modify, and distribute this code as you see fit.

## Features

- Supports multiple filter types: string, select, date, and boolean  
- Dynamically configurable fields and operators  
- Easy integration with backend APIs and data tables

## TODO

- [ ] Hook up input types (select, string, date, boolean) to the `AdvancedSearch` component  
- [ ] Connect filtered results to the `DataTable` component  
- [ ] Pass filter parameters to backend API call
